# Home-Price-Prediction

This project takes in a very large dataset containing information about the home prices in the city of Bangalore.

A very brief review of what I did in the project. 

1. Like all datasets, it can't be trained and tested without making some changes which are usually Cleaning the Data, Removing Outliers and also Updating several values so that we can use them. 

2. Now after a long and ardous process of modifying the data according to my needs and parameters, I was finally able to Train and Test my Data Model using Linear Regression. Other Regression algorithms were not the best fit. 

The main task of the project is completed by this point. This is a Machine Learning project so most of the time was invested in modifying and training the data.

3. Now I created a backend for this project using Python Flask so to make use of the model I created above effectively.

4. Last and final step was to create the frontend using basic HTML+CSS and JavaScript so that I could have an interface to predict the home prices rather than just the code terminal.
